                Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Patricia. I have a degree in Business
                Informatics and I worked as a website developer. During my work,
                I try to expand my professional knowledge as much as possible. I
                believe that continuous learning is essential for personal
                growth. I have work experience in Laravel framework, both in
                backend and frontend development. I am comfortable working with
                the Laravel Blade templates, as well as JavaScript, HTML and
                Tailwind CSS. Currently I&apos;m learning React and working on
                demo websites. In the future, I would like to get to know other
                frontend and backend frameworks.
              </p>
              <p className="pt-2">
                Currently I&apos;m looking for a job and hope I have piqued your
                interest.
